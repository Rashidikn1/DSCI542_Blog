# Corporate Challenge: Avoid Adding Useless AI to Your Products

## Why Innovation Shouldn’t Be Synonymous With Unnecessary AI

### Introduction: Apple Intelligence Is Here (Sort Of)

Apple has unveiled **Apple Intelligence**, its latest effort to integrate artificial intelligence into the iPhone. From rewriting awkward Slack messages to identifying the type of dog you just passed on your morning jog, Apple introduced a range of AI-powered features at its recent keynote. While these features might sound innovative at first, they raise an important question: **Do we really need AI for all of this?**  

The answer, as this article will argue, is no. This blog explores the overuse of AI in modern products, why it matters, and how companies can refocus on meaningful, user-centered innovation.

### Why Does This Matter?

AI has immense potential to transform industries, but its misuse comes with significant consequences:

1. **Loss of Trust:** We all know how frustrating it is when an AI tool doesn’t perform as expected. Think of the last time you asked ChatGPT to do something, only to receive a completely irrelevant answer. Or perhaps you asked it to fix mistakes in an essay, and it ended up rewriting the whole piece, making it sound robotic and stripping away your personal voice. A recent example is Apple’s Intelligence system, which generated fabricated summaries of news, confusing users. This failure forced Apple to roll back the AI system, as it was negatively impacting customers and damaging Apple’s credibility in the AI space. Poorly implemented AI frustrates users and erodes their confidence in the technology. 
2. **Wasted Resources:** Companies often allocate time and effort to superficial innovations instead of addressing core user needs. The money and time spent on developing new AI technology could have been used to refine and improve Apple’s already existing lineup of products. Did we already forget about the $3,500 Vision Pro AR Headset? What happened to it? Investing in perfecting flagship products would be more beneficial to companies in the long run.  
3. **Stalled Innovation:** This constant competition to add useless AI to products prevents companies from developing truly groundbreaking technologies. Instead, we get an emoji generator. They could have implemented an already existing news summarizer into their iPhones and focused on bigger achievements. Another option would be to polish the news summarizer feature before releasing it into production and damaging their reputation. The overuse of AI for novelty-driven features distracts from solving real problems and creating impactful solutions.

By shifting focus from novelty-driven to user-centered AI development, companies can create meaningful products that inspire trust and satisfaction.

### Arguments Against Useless AI

#### **Argument 1: The Overuse of AI as a Marketing Tool**

AI has become a buzzword, often used more for marketing than functionality. Like I mentioned above, Apple Intelligence’s emoji generator creates custom emojis based on user descriptions. While this sounds like an amusing tool, this feature offers little practical value. How many users truly need to generate a “horse emoji wearing sunglasses”? It seems like Apple is more focuse on releasing useless features over meaningful innovation. "Many new ideas solve a problem, but if you don't create value, it's just another invention" [1].

#### **Argument 2: How Poorly Implemented AI Can Frustrate Users**

When AI doesn’t work as expected, it can lead to frustration. Apple Intelligence’s notification summarizer is a prime example: while intended to save time, it generated inaccurate or fictional headlines, such as “Breaking News: Netanyahu Arrested.” Reading such news could mislead people, potentially causing unnecessary frustration or even inciting hate speech against other nations or religions. Such errors demonstrate how poorly implemented AI can undermine user confidence and create needless worry.

#### **Argument 3: The Pitfalls of Using AI to Solve Nonexistent Problems**

AI features often try to address problems that don’t exist. Apple’s Camera Control allows users to point their phone at objects and receive explanations, but Google Lens has provided this functionality since 2017. Similarly, Siri now offers step-by-step guidance on deleting duplicate photos, a task that is hardly difficult for most users. These examples highlight the misallocation of resources to solve trivial issues instead of focusing on real problems.

### What’s Next?

To move forward, companies must prioritize purposeful AI development:

1. **Focus on Reliability and Core Functionality:** Enhancing the accuracy, stability, and usability of existing AI systems should take precedence over introducing gimmicky features. For example, Apple could tackle the challenge of further improving Siri’s natural language processing which could deliver far greater value than novelty-driven additions. 
2. **Balance Innovation with Practicality:** Lastly, companies should focus on addressing real user needs with solutions that are practical, reliable, and user-friendly. Apple could instead work on their Vision Pro AR Headset because it could be revolutanery, instead of doing what is already done. Companies love using hot buzz words to atttract customers, however, image a AR feature that would help blind people navigate. This is a much better solution than implementing new features Apple intelligence provides.

### Conclusion: Less Is More

The overuse of AI in products like Apple Intelligence highlights the need for purposeful, not performative, innovation. Flashy, unnecessary features fail to provide value. It seems Apple have shifted focus from groundbreaking creations like the iPhone and MacBook to features no one asked for. Let us hope that corporations will resist the lure of superficial AI and prioritize quality-driven innovation that truly meets user needs.
